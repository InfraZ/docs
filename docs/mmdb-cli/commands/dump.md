# Dump Command 🐣

The `dump` command in MMDB CLI allows you to dump the contents of an MMDB file in a human-readable format. You can view the metadata, search for IP addresses, and extract specific fields from the database. This command is useful for exploring the structure of an MMDB file and understanding its data.

:::tip

The output file structure is designed to be human-readable and easy to understand. The data is organized into sections such as `data`, `metadata`, and `schema` to provide a clear overview of the MMDB file contents. for more information about the output structure, please refer to the [Dataset Schema](../dataset-schema.md) section.

:::

## Usage

```bash
mmdb-cli dump -i <MMDB_FILE_PATH> -o <JSON_OUTPUT_PATH>
```

## Options

- `-i, --input <MMDB_FILE_PATH>`: The path to the MMDB file from which you want to extract metadata.
- `-o, --output <JSON_OUTPUT_PATH>`: The path to the JSON file where the output will be saved. (must have a .json extension)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable the verbose mode

:::info[Supported Formats]

The `dump` command currently supports dumping the contents of an MMDB file in JSON format and `json` file extension is mandatory for the output file.

:::

## Examples

In the following example, we dump the contents of the `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` file to a JSON file:

```bash
mmdb-cli dump -i GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb -o GeoLite2-ASN.json
```

### Output (JSON):

:::note[Disclaimer]

The data shown in the examples above is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect the actual data in the MMDB file you are inspecting. The actual data may vary based on the version of the database and the IP addresses queried.
