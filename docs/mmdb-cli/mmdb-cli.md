## What is MMDB?

The **MMDB** (MaxMind Database) is a widely used database file format designed to map IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to specific data records through an efficient binary search tree structure. For more details, please refer to the [MMDB File Format Specification](https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/).

## Why MMDB CLI?

We‚Äôve always wanted a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for working with MMDB files. That‚Äôs why we developed **MMDB CLI**, to make handling MMDB files simple and efficient, without the need for coding.

With MMDB CLI, you can:

- Generate MMDB files from JSON datasets
- Modify existing MMDB files (Insert, Update, Delete)
- Dump MMDB files into JSON format
- Inspect the contents of MMDB files
- And much more‚Ä¶
