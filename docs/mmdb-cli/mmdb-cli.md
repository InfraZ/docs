# MMDB CLI

MMDB CLI is our first public open-source projecct that we have developed to help you to work with MMDB files. MMDB CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to generate, modify, export, inspect and ... MMDB files.

## What is MMDB?

The MMDB (MaxMind Database) is a popular database file format that maps IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to data records using an efficient binary search tree. For more information, you can visit the [MMDB File Format Specification](https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/).

## Why MMDB CLI?

We always wanted to have a complete and easy-to-use tool to work with MMDB files. We have developed MMDB CLI to help you to work with MMDB files in a simple and efficient way without the need to write any code.

You can use MMDB CLI to:

- Generate MMDB files from JSON datasets
- Modify existing MMDB files ( Insert, Update, Delete )
- Dump MMDB files to JSON datasets
- Inspect MMDB files
- And more...
